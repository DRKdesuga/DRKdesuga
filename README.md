# Projects üìÑ

Most of the projects on this Git account are private, but feel free to reach out if you're interested in any specific project. I can make them available upon request. 

## Featured Projects

Here are a few examples of the projects I have worked on:

- **42sh**: A custom shell implementation in C with advanced features like AST parsing and command execution.
- **Bittorrent**: A lightweight BitTorrent client with a focus on metadata parsing and efficient file handling.
- **Tiger**: A ompiler in C++, following the front-end/middle-end/back-end architecture, including lexical analysis, parsing...
- **malloc**: A custom memory allocator built from scratch, including implementations for `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`.
- **myfind**: A command-line utility similar to `find`, capable of parsing complex queries and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST).

## Contact

If you're interested in any of these projects, feel free to contact me at **hamza.hannat@epita.fr**. I'd be happy to share details or discuss potential opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
